		It seems that you have stumbled upon our little medium of communication. I don't know what you want to hear, or for the matter don't want to hear, so I shall just write what pops into my head. In it's naive honesty, and perhaps with vigor and passion. So, if you are easily offended, this will serve as a warning statement. A testament to the honesty of our conversation, where the only facade you see is the only one you expect.

		This is raw, primal, and the essence of Dong.

		First things first, hello. My name is Dong, and since this is the internet, let's keep it informal and strictly on first name basis. Besides, you being informed of my full name would be slightly creepy since that's what the NSA did and I didn't get to meet anyone of them. As South Park have said, I would at least like to be kissed before I get fucked. But moving along, Dong is my actual given first name. The smart asses would have narrowed it down to my region of birth of Asia, and those in the know would guess closer to China or Korea. And there are those good old boys who would just laugh a hearty laugh and just smile and say 'Haha, your name is Dong. Haha.' So, regardless of your response, here's more of me for you to picture life of Dong as you imagine it...
